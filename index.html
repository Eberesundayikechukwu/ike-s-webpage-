               <h3 id="life">Here's a time line of Dr . Borlaug's life:</h3>
               <ul id="unordered">

                   <li><strong style="font-size: 16px;">  1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save  up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li> <br>
                   <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;"> 1937 </strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li> <br>
                   <li> <strong  style="font-size: 16px;"> 1938 </strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li> <br>
                   <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;"> 1941 </strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
                   </li> <br>
                    <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;"> 1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology </li> <br>
                    <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;"> 1944 </strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><br>
                    <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;"> 1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li> <br>
                   <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;"> 1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>
                   <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;"> 1962 </strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li><br>
                   <li><strong style="font-size: 16px;">  1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>
                   <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;"> 1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li><br>
                   <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;"> 1984 </strong>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
                    <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;"> 2005 </strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
                    </li><br>
                    <li> <strong style="font-size: 16px;">  2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
